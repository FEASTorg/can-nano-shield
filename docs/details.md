# Details

- Description: A compact CAN transceiver/controller shield for Arduino Nano form factor, enabling reliable CAN bus communication using A4/A5 for CAN_H/L.
- Features:
  - Drop-in Nano shield format with pass-through headers
  - Uses SMT-XH???? connector off the front edge or selectable to A4/A5 pins for CAN_H and CAN_L?????
  - Onboard MCP2515 CAN controller (SPI)
  - TJA1051/3 high-speed CAN transceiver
  - Optional 120Ω termination via jumper (SPLIT TERMINATION CONCEPT!!!!!)
  - Optional common-mode choke for EMC
  - TVS diode protection on CAN lines
- Specifications:
  - 3.3V or 5V logic compatible (level shifted) VERIFY???? for ATM???
  - CAN 2.0B compliant, up to 1 Mbps
  - Standard 3-pin CAN output: CAN_H, GND, CAN_L
- MCU(s):
  - Compatible with any Arduino Nano-format MCU (e.g., ATmega328P, STM32F103, RP2040)
- Key Components:
  - MCP2515 CAN controller
  - TJA1051 or TJA1053 CAN transceiver
  - PESD2CAN TVS diode
  - Optional: Epcos B82799C0104 common-mode choke
- Template Stackup:
  - 2-layer PCB, 1.6 mm FR4, standard 1oz copper CHECKKKKKKKQ!!!!!
- Cost Estimate:
  - TBD
- Part Count:
  - TBD
- Hardware Complexity:
  - Low (simple mixed-signal I/O, minimal passive filtering)
- Firmware Complexity:
  - Low (standard MCP2515 CAN libraries)
- Design Status:
  - Prototype revision complete
- Test Status:
  - Pending full functional and bus integrity testing
- Notes:
  - I²C is unavailable on A4/A5; consider alternate breakout if needed (ADD THIS?!?!??!)
